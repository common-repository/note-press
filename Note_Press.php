 The basic structure of this plugin was cloned from the [WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate]
 (https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) project. Thanks Tom!
 
 Many of the features of the Boilerplate, such as the admin settings, css and js are included 
 in this plugin yet are not used in this version. I've went ahead and included them as I do have
 plans to use them in the future.
