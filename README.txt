You can even give access to Note Press for your Authors, Contributors and Editors. Unlike other note plugins, Note Press keeps thing extremely simple by using features familiar to all WordPress users. Simply click on the Note Press button on the Admin Menu and view a list of all notes. Or visit the dashboard to view Sticky Notes in any color.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Who can see Note Press? =

It will depend on the configuration settings.  Admins can configured Note Press so that anyone with Contributor access and above can read and write notes with Note Press.
Admins and Super Admins will be able to see all notes sent to and from all users with Note Press access.
Users who don't have Note Press access can see and delete Dashboard Sticky Notes

= What's a Sticky Note?  =

Note Press will allow you to create Sticky notes on the Wordpress Admin Dashboard and allow you to chose the color of the note.  A  Sticky note will be the only way that users, like contributors who have access to the dashboard but do not have Note Press access, can see notes sent to them.

= Does Note Press support multi-site? =
Yes, but.  There is no capability to send notes across sites.  Each site will have it's own copy of Note Press activated but each site can only send note to that site's users. 

= Can the icons be replaced? =

Yes. The icons are stored in the Note_Press/public/icons directory.  To add your own custom icons, simply upload them to that directory and Note Press will find them. Be aware that Note Press is designed for 16x16 icons.  Using icons of any other size will produce unpredictable results.

= What does the search look for? =

Note Press has the ability to search through your notes.  When doing so, it checks for matches in both the title and the contents of the note.  The search is not case-sensitive.

= How many notes can Note Press hold? =

To the limit of your database. Only 5 notes will be displayed in the list at a time though.

= Can media be stored in the notes? =

Yes. Note Press uses the same editor (Tiny MCE) used when creating posts and pages.

= Can shortcodes be used in the notes? =

Yes. Although not all shortcodes have been tested, Note Press does process the contents of your notes for shortcodes.
